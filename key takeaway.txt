we import different modules into the main 'app' module
each module has a clases named DataSource
all DataSource classes have the same signature (**kwargs)
pass a DataSource to the app and then have access to all of its methods
example:

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		import sys
		from urban_climate_csv import DataSource
		file_name = sys.argv[1]
		app = App(DataSource())
		temps_by_hour = app.read(file_name=file_name)
		app.draw(temps_by_hour)
